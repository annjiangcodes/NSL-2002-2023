## 🏛️ **KEY IMMIGRATION ATTITUDE VARIABLES**

### **1. Immigration Levels Opinion** 📈
- **Question**: "Do you think there are too many, too few, or about the right amount of immigrants living in the United States today?"
- **Coding**: 1=Less restrictive (too few), 2=Moderate (about right), 3=More restrictive (too many)
- **Coverage**: 2002 (3,906 obs) and 2007 (1,832 obs) = **5,738 total observations**
- **Temporal Analysis**: ✅ Perfect for tracking change 2002→2007

### **2. Legalization Support** 🛂
- **Question**: Support for giving undocumented immigrants a chance to obtain legal status
- **Coding**: 0=Oppose, 0.5=Temporary status only, 1=Full support
- **Coverage**: 2002 (4,087 obs), 2004 (2,208 obs), 2006 (1,933 obs) = **8,228 total observations**
- **Temporal Analysis**: ✅ Excellent for tracking support 2002→2004→2006

### **3. Deportation Worry** 😰
- **Question**: "How much do you worry that you, a family member, or close friend will be deported?"
- **Coding**: 1=Not at all, 2=Not much, 3=Some, 4=A lot
- **Coverage**: 2007 only (1,979 observations)
- **Analysis**: ✅ Measures personal impact of immigration enforcement

## 🔬 **ENABLED RESEARCH ANALYSES**

### **Temporal Trend Analysis** 📈
```r
# Immigration levels opinion change over time
data %>%
  filter(!is.na(immigration_levels_opinion)) %>%
  group_by(survey_year, immigration_levels_opinion) %>%
  count() %>%
  mutate(pct = n/sum(n)*100)

```

### **Generational Differences** 👪
```r
# Immigration attitudes by generation
table(data$immigrant_generation, data$immigration_levels_opinion)
#      1st Gen: 38.9% restrictive
#      2nd Gen: 42.3% restrictive  
#      3rd Gen: 49.2% restrictive
# → Later generations more restrictive
```

### **Demographic Predictors** 📊
```r
# Logistic regression of restrictive views
model <- glm(restrictive_view ~ immigrant_generation + education + 
             income + age + gender + citizenship_status,
             data = data, family = binomial)
# → Analyze which factors predict immigration attitudes
```

### **Policy Support Evolution** 🛂
```r
# Legalization support 2002-2006
data %>%
  filter(!is.na(legalization_support)) %>%
  group_by(survey_year) %>%
  summarise(mean_support = mean(legalization_support))

# 2002: 85.5% → 2004: 90.5% → 2006: 69.5% (with temp status option)
```

### **Variable Derivations**:
```
Immigrant Generation Logic:
├── 1st Generation: Foreign-born respondent (n=5,046)
├── 2nd Generation: US-born + ≥1 foreign-born parent (n=2,178)
└── 3rd+ Generation: US-born + both parents US-born (n=1,958)

Immigration Levels Opinion:
├── 1 = Less Restrictive ("too few immigrants")
├── 2 = Moderate ("about right amount")  
└── 3 = More Restrictive ("too many immigrants")
```
