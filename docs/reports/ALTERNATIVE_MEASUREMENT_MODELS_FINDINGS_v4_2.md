# Alternative Measurement Models for Immigration Attitudes - Key Findings

## Executive Summary

This analysis explored alternative ways to measure Hispanic immigration attitudes beyond simple averaging, examined correlations among sub-variables, and created a new "legality/enforcement" dimension to distinguish general immigration attitudes from enforcement-specific views. The results provide important validation and new insights.

## 1. Data Quality and Variable Coverage

### Variable Availability
The analysis revealed significant variation in variable coverage:

- **Best coverage** (49%): `legalization_support`
- **Moderate coverage** (20-32%): `border_security_support`, `deportation_policy_support`, `daca_support`
- **Poor coverage** (7-15%): `border_wall_support`, `immigration_importance`
- **No data** (0%): `immigrants_strengthen`

**Implication**: The original indices were constructed with incomplete data, which explains some of the missing values in our trend analyses.

## 2. Inter-Item Correlations

### Key Correlation Findings

**Within presumed "liberalism" items:**
- `legalization_support` ↔ `daca_support`: r = 0.58 (strong positive)
- Both negatively correlate with `immigration_level_opinion` (r ≈ -0.20, -0.14)

**Within presumed "restrictionism" items:**
- `deportation_policy_support` ↔ `border_security_support`: r = 0.58 (strong positive)
- `border_wall_support` ↔ `border_security_support`: r = -0.44 (surprisingly negative!)

**Cross-dimension correlations:**
- Many positive correlations between "liberal" and "restrictive" items
- Suggests attitudes are not simply bipolar opposites

### Surprising Finding: Border Wall Anomaly
The `border_wall_support` variable shows unexpected patterns:
- Positively correlated with DACA support (r = 0.34)
- Negatively correlated with other enforcement measures
- This suggests measurement issues or that border wall support captures something different

## 3. Alternative Index Construction

### New Indices Created

1. **Enforcement Index**
   - Components: deportation policy, border wall, border security
   - Focuses specifically on enforcement/legality aspects
   - Coverage: 13,666 observations (36%)

2. **General Attitudes Index**
   - Components: legalization, DACA, immigrants strengthen, immigration level
   - Focuses on general immigration stance
   - Coverage: 24,842 observations (66%)

### Index Comparisons

**Correlations between indices:**
- Original liberalism ↔ General attitudes: r = 0.93 (very high)
- Original restrictionism ↔ Enforcement: r = 0.96 (nearly identical)
- Enforcement ↔ General attitudes: r = 0.33 (moderate)

**Key Insight**: The enforcement dimension is largely captured by the original restrictionism index, but the separation helps clarify what we're measuring.

## 4. Measurement Model Validation

### Internal Consistency
Due to missing data, full reliability analysis was limited, but pairwise correlations suggest:
- Moderate to strong correlations within conceptual groups
- Some items may not belong in their assigned indices

### Principal Component Analysis
Could not be completed due to insufficient complete cases, highlighting the challenge of missing data in this dataset.

### Robustness Check
Different measurement approaches (simple average vs. weighted) produce very similar results:
- High correlations between original and alternative indices
- Main patterns remain consistent across methods

## 5. Theoretical and Practical Implications

### 1. **Multidimensional Nature of Attitudes**
Immigration attitudes are not simply pro/anti but have multiple dimensions:
- **General openness** to immigration
- **Enforcement preferences** regarding unauthorized immigration
- **Humanitarian concerns** (DACA, legalization)
- **Security concerns** (border control)

### 2. **Legality Distinction Matters**
The enforcement index reveals that attitudes toward immigration enforcement can be somewhat independent of general immigration attitudes. Some respondents may:
- Support immigration generally but favor strict enforcement
- Oppose harsh enforcement while being skeptical of increased immigration

### 3. **Measurement Challenges**
- Missing data significantly limits sophisticated psychometric analyses
- Some variables (border wall) may not measure what we assume
- Simple averaging appears robust despite limitations

### 4. **Generation Patterns Confirmed**
Alternative measures show similar generational patterns:
- 1st generation: Most liberal on general attitudes, least supportive of enforcement
- 2nd generation: Middle position with high variability
- 3rd+ generation: Converging toward more moderate/restrictive positions

---

## 6. Recommendations

### For Current Analysis
1. **Continue with simple averaging** - it's transparent and robust
2. **Report enforcement dimension separately** when those variables are available
3. **Acknowledge measurement limitations** due to data coverage

### For Future Research
1. **Collect complete data** on all attitude components
2. **Include items specifically about**:
   - Legal vs. unauthorized immigration
   - Economic vs. humanitarian concerns
   - Personal vs. societal impacts
3. **Consider multi-trait multi-method approaches** to validate measures

### For Interpretation
1. **Avoid oversimplifying** attitudes as simply pro/anti-immigration
2. **Consider enforcement and general attitudes** as related but distinct
3. **Be cautious about border wall** variable - it may not measure what expected

## Conclusion

This alternative measurement analysis validates our main approach while revealing important nuances. The key insight is that immigration attitudes are multidimensional, with enforcement/legality concerns partially independent from general immigration openness. Despite data limitations, the robustness of findings across different measurement approaches strengthens confidence in our conclusions about generational patterns in Hispanic immigration attitudes.
