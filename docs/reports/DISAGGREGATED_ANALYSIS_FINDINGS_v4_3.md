# Disaggregated Sub-Variable Analysis - Key Findings (v4.3)

## Executive Summary

The disaggregated analysis of individual immigration attitude components reveals significant heterogeneity within our aggregate indices. Several sub-variables show patterns that diverge from the overall trends, providing crucial insights into the complexity of Hispanic immigration attitudes.

## 1. Coverage and Data Availability

### Variable Coverage (by years of data):
1. **Support for Legalization** - 5 years (best coverage)
2. **DACA Support** - 4 years
3. **Deportation Worry** - 4 years
4. **Immigration as Top Issue** - 4 years
5. **Border Security** - 3 years
6. **Deportation Support** - 3 years
7. **Reduce Immigration Levels** - 3 years
8. **Border Wall Support** - 2 years (limited)

## 2. Key Finding: Divergent Generational Patterns

### Variables Showing Sign Changes Between Generations

Four variables show patterns where 1st and 3rd+ generations move in opposite directions at different times:

1. **Border Security** (mean diff = 0.160)
   - Shows the most complex pattern
   - Generations diverge and converge at different periods

2. **DACA Support** (mean diff = -0.237) 
   - Strong generational differences
   - Pattern doesn't match overall liberalism index

3. **Support for Legalization** (mean diff = -0.224)
   - Similar to DACA but with different timing

4. **Reduce Immigration Levels** (mean diff = -0.030)
   - Smaller differences but still shows sign changes

**Implication**: These variables don't always move together as assumed by the aggregate indices.

## 3. Heterogeneity Within Categories

### Pro-Immigration Components
- **Support for Legalization**: 1st gen ↑, 2nd gen ↓
- **DACA Support**: 1st gen ↑, 2nd gen ↓
- These two supposedly similar items show different trajectories

### Restrictive Components  
- **Border Wall Support**: 1st gen ↓, 2nd gen ↑ (opposite directions!)
- **Deportation Support**: 1st gen ↑, 2nd gen ↓
- **Border Security**: 1st gen ↑, 2nd gen ↓
- **Immigration as Top Issue**: Mixed patterns

**Key Insight**: Restrictive attitudes are NOT monolithic - different enforcement measures elicit different responses.

---

## 4. Surprising Patterns

### 1. **Border Wall Paradox**
- 1st generation becomes LESS supportive of border wall over time
- 2nd generation becomes MORE supportive
- This is opposite to most other restrictive measures
- Confirms our correlation finding that border wall attitudes are distinct

### 2. **First Generation Complexity**
- Shows increasing support for legalization AND deportation
- Suggests nuanced views: support pathways for some, enforcement for others
- Not simply "pro" or "anti" immigration

### 3. **Second Generation Volatility**
- Most variable across different measures
- Often moves opposite to 1st generation
- Suggests identity negotiation and contextual responses

## 5. Implications for Index Construction

### Current Approach Limitations
1. **Oversimplification**: Averaging masks important variation
2. **Dimensional Confusion**: Some items don't belong together
3. **Generational Assumptions**: Patterns vary by specific attitude

### Recommendations
1. **Report Disaggregated Results**: Show individual items when possible
2. **Reconsider Border Wall**: May need separate treatment
3. **Context Matters**: Different aspects of immigration elicit different responses

---

## 6. Theoretical Implications

### 1. **Multidimensional Attitudes Confirmed**
- Humanitarian concerns (DACA, legalization) ≠ Security concerns (border, deportation)
- Economic concerns (immigration levels) separate from both
- Symbolic concerns (border wall) unique

### 2. **Generation-Specific Patterns**
- **1st Generation**: Pragmatic - support pathways AND enforcement
- **2nd Generation**: Reactive - responds to political climate
- **3rd+ Generation**: Selective - adopts mainstream views differentially

### 3. **Assimilation Is Selective**
- Not uniform across all attitudes
- Some attitudes converge, others diverge
- Context and political climate matter

## 7. Visualizations Created

1. **All Sub-variables** (`figure_v4_3_all_subvariables.png`)
   - Comprehensive view of all 8 components
   - Shows full heterogeneity

2. **By Category** (`figure_v4_3_by_category.png`)
   - Groups pro-immigration vs restrictive
   - Reveals within-category variation

3. **Key Contrasts** (`figure_v4_3_key_contrasts.png`)
   - Focuses on most important comparisons
   - Highlights divergent patterns

4. **Heterogeneity Analysis** (`figure_v4_3_heterogeneity.png`)
   - Shows consistency within categories over time
   - Reveals periods of agreement/disagreement

---

## 8. Methodological Validation

### Robustness Check Results
- Aggregate patterns hold for MOST variables
- But important exceptions exist
- Disaggregation reveals nuance missed by indices

### Model Comparison
- Simple averaging: Convenient but masks variation
- Component analysis: More accurate but complex
- Recommendation: Use both approaches

## 9. Key Takeaways

1. **Immigration attitudes are genuinely multidimensional** - not just methodological artifact

2. **Border wall attitudes are unique** - don't fit neatly into restrictionism

3. **Generational patterns vary by specific issue** - no uniform assimilation

4. **Second generation is most complex** - not simply "in between"

5. **Context and framing matter** - "enforcement" means different things

---

## 10. Future Research Priorities

1. **Qualitative Follow-up**: Why do border wall attitudes differ?

2. **Experimental Studies**: Test framing effects on different measures

3. **Panel Data**: Track individual attitude change

4. **Regional Analysis**: Do patterns vary by location?

5. **Issue Salience**: When do specific attitudes matter for behavior?

## Conclusion

This disaggregated analysis validates our overall findings while revealing crucial nuances. The main story of generational differences remains, but the specific patterns are more complex than aggregate indices suggest. Immigration attitudes among U.S. Hispanics are truly multidimensional, with different components following different trajectories. This complexity has important implications for both theory and policy.
