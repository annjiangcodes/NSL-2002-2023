- [ ] Implement missing data corrections (listwise vs imputation)
- [ ] Geographic stratification analysis (key states)
- [ ] Age cohort analysis to separate period vs cohort effects
- [ ] Compare with 1-2 external polling sources
- [ ] Sensitivity analysis with different time periods

#### **Week 3: Presentation Development (20-30 hours)**
- [ ] Develop theoretical framework/literature context
- [ ] Create compelling narrative arc

- [ ] Prepare for Q&A on methodological concerns
- [ ] Practice presentation timing

#### **Week 4: Final Polish (10-15 hours)**
- [ ] Peer feedback incorporation
- [ ] Final data checks and validation
- [ ] Presentation rehearsal
- [ ] Backup slides for detailed questions

### **Conference Presentation Scope:**
```
TITLE: "The Immigration Attitude Paradox: How Latino Views Became More Liberal 
        During the Era of Restrictionist Politics (2002-2023)"

KEY POINTS:
‚Ä¢ Counter-intuitive finding: Liberal shift during restrictionist era
‚Ä¢ Generational convergence rather than divergence  
‚Ä¢ Disconnect between immigration attitudes and political behavior
‚Ä¢ Methodological transparency about limitations
‚Ä¢ Call for further research on attitude-behavior gap
```

- [ ] Abstract, introduction, methods, results, discussion
- [ ] Table and figure preparation
- [ ] Supplementary materials preparation
- [ ] Citation management and bibliography
- [ ] Internal consistency checks

#### **Month 6: Revision & Submission (30-50 hours)**
- [ ] Peer review and feedback incorporation

## ‚öñÔ∏è **RESOURCE REQUIREMENTS COMPARISON**

### **Conference Presentation:**
- **Time**: 100-135 total hours (3-4 weeks full-time)
- **Skills Needed**: 
  - Statistical analysis (intermediate)
  - Data visualization (intermediate)
  - Presentation design (basic)
- **Software**: R, ggplot2, basic survey packages
- **Risk Level**: Low (preliminary findings accepted)

### **Journal Manuscript:**

## üö¶ **RECOMMENDED APPROACH**

### **Phase 1: Conference Presentation First**
**Why:** 
- Get preliminary feedback from experts
- Test audience reception of key findings
- Identify methodological concerns early
- Build academic network around this research

### **Phase 2: Use Conference Feedback for Journal**
**Benefits:**
- Address reviewer concerns proactively
- Refine theoretical framework based on discussion
- Identify additional analyses suggested by peers
- Strengthen argument based on Q&A insights

---

## üí° **EFFICIENCY STRATEGIES**

### **For Conference Prep:**
1. **Focus on core finding** - don't try to solve everything
2. **Acknowledge limitations explicitly** - transparency builds credibility
3. **Prepare for the contradiction question** - this will dominate Q&A
4. **Have backup slides** for methodological deep-dives

### **For Journal Manuscript:**
1. **Start literature review during conference prep**
2. **Automate analysis pipeline** for reproducibility
3. **Write methods section early** while fresh in memory
4. **Consider collaborative feedback** from conference contacts

---

## üéØ **SUCCESS METRICS**

### **Conference Presentation Success:**
- Positive audience engagement
- Methodological questions rather than dismissal
- Interest from other researchers
- Invitation for collaboration/follow-up

### **Journal Manuscript Success:**
- Clear contribution to literature
- Robust methodology that survives peer review
- Policy relevance and media attention
- Citation potential and field impact
