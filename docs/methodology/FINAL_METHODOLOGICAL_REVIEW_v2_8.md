### **3. Variable Construction**

#### **Immigration Policy Liberalism Index**
- **Components**: Legalization support, DACA support
- **Coverage**: 8+ years, 61% of observations
- **Interpretation**: Higher = more liberal immigration policies

#### **Immigration Policy Restrictionism Index**
- **Components**: Border wall support, deportation policy support, "too many immigrants"
- **Coverage**: 9+ years, 64% of observations  
- **Interpretation**: Higher = more restrictionist immigration policies

#### **Deportation Concern Index**
- **Components**: Personal deportation worry
- **Coverage**: 4+ years, 22% of observations
- **Interpretation**: Higher = greater deportation concerns

## **üìä Key Empirical Findings**

### **Primary Pattern: Generational Convergence**
1. **First Generation Polarization**: Simultaneous increases in BOTH liberalism and restrictionism
2. **Second Generation Assimilation**: Decreasing trends toward mainstream attitudes
3. **Third+ Generation Stability**: Minimal change over time

### **Statistical Evidence (Survey-Weighted v2.8)**
```
FIRST GENERATION:
- Liberalism: +0.019 per year (p=0.021*)
- Restrictionism: +0.011 per year (p=0.004**)

SECOND GENERATION:  
- Liberalism: -0.005 per year (p=0.488, ns)
- Restrictionism: -0.015 per year (p=0.056, ns)

THIRD+ GENERATION:
- Liberalism: -0.016 per year (p=0.158, ns)  
- Restrictionism: -0.002 per year (p=0.908, ns)
```

### **Theoretical Implications**
- **Assimilation Theory**: Supported for 2nd/3rd+ generations
- **Political Polarization**: First generation shows unique pattern
- **Context Effects**: Presidential administrations may influence trends

- **Strategy**: Complete case analysis may introduce selection bias
- **Mitigation**: Sensitivity analysis, focus on robust indices

### **2. Survey Design Changes**
- **Question Wording**: Some variations across survey years
- **Mode Effects**: Telephone vs. web vs. in-person interviews
- **Panel Effects**: ATP longitudinal respondents vs. cross-sectional
- **Mitigation**: Year fixed effects, survey weight adjustments

### **3. Generational Measurement**
- **Self-Report**: Potential misclassification of nativity status
- **Family Complexity**: Mixed-status families not fully captured
- **Historical Context**: Different immigration cohorts over time
- **Mitigation**: Conservative coding, sensitivity to historical periods

### **4. Causal Inference**
- **Observational Data**: Cannot establish causality
- **Confounding**: Multiple simultaneous changes (politics, economy, demographics)
- **Selection**: Who participates in surveys may change over time
- **Mitigation**: Focus on descriptive trends, acknowledge limitations

## **üìã Remaining Gaps & Future Enhancements**

### **Priority 1: Demographic Controls (Optional)**
- **Age Effects**: Control for life-cycle vs. cohort effects
- **Education**: Immigration attitudes vary by educational attainment
- **Geographic**: Regional differences in immigration attitudes
- **Implementation**: Add controls to v2.8 weighted analysis

### **Priority 2: Event-Based Analysis (Future)**
- **Policy Events**: DACA, family separation, COVID-19
- **Election Cycles**: Presidential transitions and campaign effects
- **Implementation**: Time-series interrupted design

### **Priority 3: Comparative Analysis (Future)**
- **Cross-Ethnic**: Compare with non-Hispanic attitudes
- **International**: Compare with other immigrant-receiving countries
- **Implementation**: Expand dataset to include comparison groups
