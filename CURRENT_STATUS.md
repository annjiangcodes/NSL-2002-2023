# CURRENT STATUS - NSL PROJECT
**As of:** August 8, 2025

## Quick Start:
```r
# Load current master dataset
df <- read_csv('latest/master_data.csv')

# Run current analysis
source('latest/master_analysis.R')
```

## Key Findings (Current):
- **Generation Recovery:** 95.7% (35,871 observations)
- **Time Span:** 2002-2022 (20 years)
- **Best Coverage:** Restrictionism Index (62.7%)
- **Main Pattern:** 1st gen volatile, 2nd gen stable, 3rd+ conservative

## Technical Status:
- ✅ Mixed-effects models implemented
- ✅ Confidence intervals calculated
- ✅ Bug fixes completed (v2.9c)
- ✅ Enhanced weighting (v2.9w+)
- ✅ Publication-ready figures

## Files Organization:
- `current/` - Active development (August 8, 2025 versions)
- `latest/` - Symlinks for easy access
- Original locations - All historical versions preserved

See `VERSION_MAPPING.md` for complete file relationships.

## Legacy v4.x / v5.x Materials
- A catalog of v4.x and v5.x assets (docs, scripts, outputs) is available in:
  `docs/VERSION_MAPPING_V4_V5.md`
- Guidance:
  - v4.x/v5.x files are retained for provenance and comparison
  - Some v4.x/v5.x narratives reflect pre-correction interpretations (e.g., 2nd gen “volatile”)
  - For current claims, prefer v2.9w+ enhanced analysis and August 2025 figures
