# 2. Isolating the Foreign-Born Subsample
# Q4 responses are documented as words: "U.S.", "Puerto Rico", or "foreign country".
# We create a binary variable: foreign_born = 1 if Q4 is "foreign country", 0 otherwise.

# 3. Defining Outcome Variables Using the Documented Coding

# (a) Trump Support (Q14A)
# Documented responses: "Approve", "Disapprove", "Don't know", "Refused"
# We'll code "Approve" as 1 and "Disapprove" as 0; others become NA.

    tolower(trimws(qn14a)) == "approve"    ~ 1,
    tolower(trimws(qn14a)) == "disapprove" ~ 0,
    TRUE ~ NA_real_
  ))

    tolower(trimws(qn29)) == "favor"  ~ 1,
    tolower(trimws(qn29)) == "oppose" ~ 0,
    TRUE ~ NA_real_
  ))

# Verify 
table(nsl_data$favor_wall)

# (c) Opinion on Immigrant Population (Q31)
# Documented responses: "Too many", "Too few", "Right amount", plus "Don't know"/"Refused".
# We code "Too many" as 1 (anti-immigration) and "Too few" or "Right amount" as 0.

# (d) Conservative Orientation â€“ Party Identification (PARTY)

# We'll code "Republican" as 1 (conservative) and others ("Democrat", "Independent", etc.) as 0.

# Flag a respondent as "conservative/anti-immigration/trump supporting/too many immigrants" if at least one of the following is true:
#   - Approves of Trump (trump_support == 1)
#   - Favors the border wall (favor_wall == 1)
#   - Believes there are too many immigrants (too_many_imm == 1)
#   - Identifies as Republican (conservative == 1)
