## **üéØ COVERAGE ANALYSIS**

### **üèÜ Excellent Coverage (80%+)**
- **Education**: Strong across NSL surveys (2014-2018) and ATP (2021)
- **Employment**: Excellent in recent years (2018: 97.3%, 2021: 95.8%)
- **Survey Weights**: Perfect coverage in 2014, 2018, 2021
- **Geographic**: Complete coverage in ATP 2021 and NSL 2015

### **‚ö†Ô∏è Good Coverage (50-79%)**
- **Income**: Good coverage in NSL surveys (58-77%)

### **‚ùå Needs Improvement (0-49%)**
- **2023 ATP**: All variables need mapping verification
- **Employment**: Earlier years need alternative variable identification
- **Geographic**: NSL surveys missing regional identifiers

---

## **üîß TECHNICAL IMPLEMENTATION**

### **Enhanced Harmonization Framework**
- **Script**: `scripts/02_harmonization/04_data_harmonization_SOCIOECONOMIC_GEOGRAPHIC.R`
- **Functions**: 12 specialized harmonization functions
- **Error Handling**: Robust multi-encoding file loading
- **Quality Control**: Automated coverage reporting

### **Variable Mapping Strategy**
```r
# Example: Income harmonization across survey types
income_var_map <- list(
  "2018" = "income",      # NSL format
  "2022" = "I_INCOME",    # ATP format
  "2014" = "income"       # Legacy NSL
)
```

### **Data Quality Features**
- **Consistent missing value handling** (8, 9, 98, 99 ‚Üí NA)
- **Cross-survey standardization** (different scales ‚Üí unified categories)
- **Extreme value cleaning** (survey weights > 10 ‚Üí NA)
- **Comprehensive coverage reporting** with color-coded status

## **üöÄ RESEARCH CAPABILITIES ENABLED**

### **üî¨ Advanced Analytical Possibilities**

#### **Socioeconomic Stratification**
- **Income-based analysis**: Political attitudes by economic status
- **Educational attainment effects**: College graduation impact on immigration views
- **Employment status**: How work status affects political participation

#### **Geographic Analysis**

2. **"Do college-educated Latinos in different regions have different political priorities?"**
3. **"What is the urban-rural divide in Latino political attitudes?"**
4. **"How do employment disruptions influence political party identification?"**
